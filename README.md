# Three-way-decisions-through-RST
Exam master's degree
Requests:
  1. Implement a Python package (3WD package) containing all the functions needed to execute
  the Three-Way Decisions approach (based on Probabilistic Rough Sets) on Decision Tables
  provided as CSV files.
  2. Choose a suitable and interesting dataset from a repository on the Web.
  3. Design a data analysis method (choose goals, conditional attributes and decision attributes)
  based on Sequential Three-Way Decisions to process the selected dataset.
  4. Write a Python program (main script), invoking your 3WD package, to process the selected
  dataset by using the defined method.
  5. Write a document describing all the previous steps (also the parameter values) and discuss the
  analysis results showing their usefulness and how a decision maker tries benefits from them.
Hints
  • Step 2 and step 3 are very important.
  • The 3WD package must be generic (it provides Three-Way Decisions on any Decision Table
  organized as a CSV file.
  • The Main Script can be specific for the dataset you have selected.
  • The “sequential” part of the work can be implemented in the Main Script by writing a
  specialized function.
  Python tools
  • You can use Pandas, NumPy and other Python libraries you consider effective to achieve the
  goal.
  • Use Spyder (in the Anaconda package) to write the program. You must create a Spyder
  Project.
